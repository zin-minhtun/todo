In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## After running the command 

If u got some error like "react-scripts" is not recognized as an internal or external command, check your react-script dependency is avaliable or not in package.json

If not available then add manually via:

### `npm install react-scripts --save`

Or if available then:

### `npm install`
